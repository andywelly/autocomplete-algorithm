Autocomplete Lookup

This repository contains the code and report for the Algorithms and Data Structures Subjec, focusing on implementing autocomplete lookup using two different data structures: a sorted array and a radix tree.

## Project Overview

This assignment involved two main stages:

1.  **Stage 2: Sorted Array Implementation:**
    * Reading data from a CSV file.
    * Storing business data in a dynamically resized, sorted array.
    * Implementing binary search for efficient insertion, find, and traverse operations.
2.  **Stage 3: Radix Tree Implementation:**
    * Reading data from the same CSV file.
    * Storing business data in a radix tree, using binary representations of characters for branching.
    * Implementing search functionality to find matching entries.

# Autocomplete Lookup

This repository contains the code and report for the Algorithms and Data Structures Subjec, focusing on implementing autocomplete lookup using two different data structures: a sorted array and a radix tree.

## Description

This C project implements an autocomplete feature using both sorted arrays and radix trees, enabling a comparative analysis of algorithmic efficiency. A detailed report compares the performance of these data structures using Big-O notation, highlighting the trade-offs between them. This project significantly enhanced my understanding of algorithmic efficiency and the importance of data structure selection. Furthermore, it provided valuable experience in manipulating data into various types to optimize performance.

## Project Overview

This assignment involved two main stages:

1.  **Stage 2: Sorted Array Implementation:**
    * Reading data from a CSV file.
    * Storing business data in a dynamically resized, sorted array.
    * Implementing binary search for efficient insertion, find, and traverse operations.
2.  **Stage 3: Radix Tree Implementation:**
    * Reading data from the same CSV file.
    * Storing business data in a radix tree, using binary representations of characters for branching.
    * Implementing search functionality to find matching entries.
